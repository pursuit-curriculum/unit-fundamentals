# Recursion

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Identify what recursion is and when it can be helpful to implement.
- Identify the critical components of a recursive function.
- Rewrite algorithms that use loops to use recursion.
- Rewrite algorithms that use recursion to use loops.

## Guiding questions

1. What is recursion, and why is it a powerful technique for solving complex problems in programming?

1. In what situations is recursion particularly useful? Can you think of real-world scenarios where recursive thinking might apply?

1. What are the essential components of a recursive function? How does a recursive function differ from a regular function?

1. Why is it crucial for a recursive function to have a base case? Can you provide an example of a recursive function without a base case and explain what might happen?

1. In the "Adding numbers" example, we demonstrated how to use recursion to calculate the sum of an array of numbers. Can you explain the step-by-step process of how the recursive function works in this example?

1. In the countdown examples provided, what are the similarities and differences between the for loop, while loop, and recursive versions of the countdown function? Which one do you find more readable and why?
