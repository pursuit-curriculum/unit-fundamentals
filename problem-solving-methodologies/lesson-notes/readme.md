# Problem Solving Methodology

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Analyze a coding problem by asking clarifying questions.
- Devise multiple ways to solve a single problem before intentionally choosing one.
- Evaluate a code solution with sample inputs and outputs.
- Reflect back on a solution, identifying areas for improvement.

## Guiding Questions

- What is the significance of problem-solving skills for a software developer?

- Why is it important to understand a problem thoroughly before attempting to solve it?

- Consider the example of planning a trip from New York City to Los Angeles. How can you apply problem-solving techniques to tackle such a complex problem effectively?

- Explain the four steps of Polya's problem-solving technique: "Understand the problem," "Devise a plan," "Solve it," and "Reflect back." How might these steps be useful in various problem-solving scenarios?

- How does understanding key terms and clarifying questions play a crucial role in approaching problems?

- Discuss the concept of seeking multiple paths when devising a plan to solve a problem. Why might having multiple approaches be beneficial in problem solving, and when might you choose one approach over another?

- Can you think of real-world scenarios where the principles of problem solving discussed in this chapter could be applied outside of coding?

- Why is it important to check for correctness in your solution, and what methods can be used to verify the correctness of code?

- Take a look at the following logic problem. Use Polya's Problem Solving Technique to help you solve this problem. Even if you think you know the answer, go through each step of the process.

  > Five people were running a race. **A**iden finished before **B**rooke, but behind **C**ory. **D**esmond finished before **E**leanor, but behind **B**rooke. What was the finishing order?

- Take a look at the following logic problem. Use Polya's Problem Solving Technique to help you solve this problem. Even if you think you know the answer, go through each step of the process.

  > A girl meets a snake and a deer in the forest. The snake lies every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and the other days he speaks the truth. The deer lies on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, and the other days of the week she speaks the truth. “Yesterday I was lying,” the snake told the girl. “So was I,” said the a deer. What day is it?
