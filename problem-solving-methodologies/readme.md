# Problem Solving Methodologies

Learning to code is only one part of being a software developer. The most important skill to develop is your ability to identify and solve problems. While you may not consciously know it, everyone employs different techniques and strategies when it comes to solving different kinds of problems. A developer is someone who knows how to problem solve and then can solve problems by writing code so that computers can solve those same problems.

In this lesson, you'll learn about some common ways to solve problems. You'll also deep dive into one particular problem solving technique. Finally, you'll learn how to apply those techniques to typical coding challenges you might see during an interview.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Analyze a coding problem by asking clarifying questions.
- Devise multiple ways to solve a single problem before intentionally choosing one.
- Evaluate a code solution with sample inputs and outputs.
- Reflect back on a solution, identifying areas for improvement.

## How do we solve problems?

What's the fastest way to get from New York City to Los Angeles, California, and then back again?

Your first inclination may be to look up the answer on a service like Google Maps. But, consider this: how does Google Maps solve this problem? If you were working for Google, you would have to consider a number of factors including:

- What mode of transportation is available?
- Does weather or road closures impact travel at all?
- Are there any human considerations for the travel? (e.g., needing to sleep)

After consider these factors and others, Google engineers would then need to figure out how to calculate the amount of time it would take. For a difficult question like this, where could you even start?

- You could _guess and check,_ by making an estimate based on the factors identified and then actually having someone do the trip to see if you're at all close.
- You could start by _solving a smaller problem._ For example, first figure out how long it would take to get from New York City to Trenton, New Jersey. By solving a number of these smaller problems, you could then potentially add up the times you've calculated.
- You could _try all possible avenues,_ also sometimes called using "brute force." Instead of worrying about any factors, you may just calculate every possible path to Los Angeles and then determine the shortest one.

There are many ways to go about solving this problem, some better than others. As a software developer, when you encounter a problem you don't instantly know how to solve, it can be useful to have a structured technique for approaching the problem so that you stay on track.

## Polya's problem solving technique

One structured technique for solving any kind of problem is [Polya's Problem Solving Technique](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf). Developed in the 1940s, this technique can be applied in all kinds of situations. Polya's technique has four discrete steps, each of which can be applied to challenges you encounter in both the real world and while writing code.

### Understand the problem

The first step is to understand the question. This means making sure you understand what the question is asking as well as asking clarifying questions.

#### Key terms

For example, take a look at the following coding prompt:

```
Write a recursive function that takes an integer and returns its associated
Fibonacci number as defined by the Fibonacci sequence.
```

This question is dense with technical and mathematic terms. In order to understand what is being asked, you'll need to be able to understand a number of key terms including:

- recursive function
- integer
- Fibonacci number and sequence

Without understanding the terms above, you'll certainly find it difficult to develop a solution for this problem. This is why your first step in approaching a problem should be to make sure you understand all of the key terms present in the problem prompt.

#### Inputs and output

Although applicable to all kinds of problems, it's particularly important with coding problems to understand the inputs and the output. Inputs refers to what information you will have in order to solve the problem. Output refers to what kind of result is needed.

For example, take a look at the following problem:

```
How many slices of pizza can be bought for $25?
```

In the question above, the input you have is the amount of money: $25. The output is the number of slices that can be bought.

#### Clarifying questions

Additionally, it's normal to question the boundaries of the problem, so you can better find a solution. These kind of clarifying questions are useful for understand what you should and should not focus on.

For example, consider the following question:

```
On average, how many adults rode the New York City Subway each day in the
summer months of 2010?
```

The question above is pretty specific, but when you dig into the problem, you may come up with a number of questions:

- What age range counts as being an adult?
- What date range is considered for summer months?
- If an adult rode the subway multiple times in a day, how often should they be counted?

These kind of questions allow you to figure out both base requirements and edge cases.

### Devise a plan

Once you accurately understand the problem to the best of your ability, it's time to figure out how you are going to solve it. While a few problems have a single way of completing them, many complex problems allow for multiple approaches.

#### Seek multiple paths

Consider the following problem:

```
Apply a 20% discount on all purchases over $100.
```

After spending time understanding the problem, including inputs and outputs, it's time to think about how you would solve this problem. While this is a relatively straightforward problem, you could solve it in a couple different ways:

1. Get the discount by multiplying the total by `0.2`. Then, subtract the discount from the total.
2. Multiply the total by `0.8`.

Is there a "right" answer here? Not necessarily. If each one achieves the same goal, then in many ways it's up to you which path to choose. However, the second option above is a bit simpler. Coming up with multiple options can sometimes lead to you finding a more elegant solution.

#### Coding paths

Particularly when it comes to coding, there are a lot of ways to attain the same result. For example, `if/else` statements are sometimes interchangeable with `switch` statements. Whenever you use a method like `.push()` you could be using array indexing. Arrays and objects can often be used similarly, depending on the type of problem.

With code, it's important to consider qualities like efficiency, readability, and flexibility. It's also important to consider which path seems most possible for you to do.

### Solve it

Once you understand the problem and have a path to take in mind, it's time to actually solve the problem. At this point, coming up with a solution will still be difficult. However, with all the work you've done up to this point, it should be significantly easier than attempting do all of the previous steps at once.

As an example, consider the following problem.

```
How many quarters would you need to stack on top of each other to reach the height of the Empire State Building?
```

First, you may begin by asking some clarifying questions. For example:

- What is the thickness of a quarter?
- How tall is the Empire State Building?

The answers to these questions will define your inputs. The thickness of a quarter is 0.069 inches. The height of the Empire State Building is 1,454 feet.

Next, you may think through a few different ways to solve this problem. After considering a few different options, you may come up with the following plan:

> To solve this problem I will first convert the height of the Empire State Building from feet to inches. Then, I will divide the height of the Empire State Building by the thickness of each quarter. That should tell me how many quarters could be stacked up to reach the height of the Empire State Building.

The above plan essentially describes your implementation. At the end of executing that plan, you should be left with the output: the number of quarters that would need to be stacked to reach the height of the Empire State Building.

That's not to say it won't be tricky. You would still need to perform the conversion from feet to inches and divide some pretty complex numbers. However, at this point, you may be able to use a calculator or look up how to perform these tasks. While a calculator can help you with the calculations, it can't help you in getting to this point!

### Reflect back

Once you've written your solution, it's important to reflect back on what you've just done. While there are many important reasons to look back, two of the most important are to check your solution for correctness and then check for potential improvements.

#### Check for correctness

Depending on how you're solving your problem, checking for correctness may be very easy. If you're writing code, you could run your code to see if you get the desired result. You might also run tests against your code, to verify it works in a number of ways.

If you're working on a problem where it's more difficult to check for correctness, you may instead just be checking your work. For example, consider the following problem:

```
Write an application for a fellowship that will be accepted.
```

If you are tackling the above problem, you can't really know if your application will be accepted until it is or is not. However, you can certainly do your best to check your work, make sure you've completed the application in full, and check for any mistakes you may have made.

#### Making improvements

There are almost always ways to improve your solution. Whether by making it more efficient or elegant, it's important to look back at difficult problems you face and consider how you could make it better next time.

When it comes to code, there are a number of common improvements that can often be made, even if the code you've written works for your situation.

- Can you make the code easier to read? Perhaps you need to add comments, or update some variable names to be more clear.
- Can you make the code more efficient? Perhaps you can rethink how you loop through data, or how much memory a solution uses.
- Can you remove any duplicate code blocks? Perhaps you can make helper functions or leverage scope in a different way.
- Can you refactor the code to be more reusable for the future? Perhaps you can change hardcoded values to variables that may be changed in the future.

Even spending just a few moments looking back at the code you've written to improve it can make a huge difference for the quality of your solution.
